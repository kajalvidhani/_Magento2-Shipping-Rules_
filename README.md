# _Magento2-Shipping-Rules_
Magento 2 Shipping Rules lets admin create flexible shipping rules based on the product attributes and shipping cart attributes.  

Default Magento does not allow to configure flexible shipping rules. E-commerce business demands to configure shipping rules based on attributes of the products, cart, delivery, etc. So, Meetanshi has developed Magento 2 Shipping Rules extension to let the Magento 2 store admin implement custom shipping rules. 

Create an unlimited number of shipping rules with Magento 2 Shipping Rules. Offer flexible shipping options, adjust shipping options per product, offer discounts, and much more!
